Title:
File Operations — Display First N Lines & Find Word Frequency

AIM:
To develop a Python program that accepts a file name from the user and performs the following operations:
1. Displays the first N lines of the file.
2. Finds the frequency of occurrence of a word accepted from the user in the file.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Accept the file name from the user.
3. Open the file in read mode.
4. Accept the number N (lines to display) from the user.
5. Read the first N lines and display them.
6. Accept a word from the user.
7. Count how many times that word occurs in the file using the count() function.
8. Display the frequency of the given word.
9. Close the file.
10. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to perform file operations:
# 1. Display the first N lines of a file
# 2. Find the frequency of a given word in the file
filename = input("Enter the file name: ")
try:
# Step 1: Open the file in read mode
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
lines = file.readlines()
# Step 2: Display the first N lines
n = int(input("Enter the number of lines to display: "))
print(f"\nFirst {n} lines of the file:")
for i in range(min(n, len(lines))):
print(lines[i], end='')
# Step 3: Find frequency of a word
word = input("\n\nEnter the word to find its frequency: ")
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
content = file.read()
freq = content.count(word)
print(f"\nThe word '{word}' occurs {freq} times in the file.")
except FileNotFoundError:
print("Error: File not found. Please check the file name and try again.")

Output:
Enter the file name:sample.txt
Enter the number of lines to display:2
First 2 lines of the file:
Hardwork is the on;y way to success
regret is painful than hardwork
Enter the word to find its frequency:is
The word'is' occurs 2 timmes in the file.

Result:
Thus, the Python program that displays the first N lines of a file and finds the frequency of a given word was successfully
written, executed, and verified.
