Title:
Merge Selected Pages from Multiple PDFs to a New PDF

AIM:
To write a Python program that combines selected pages from multiple PDF files into a new single PDF using a suitable
Python module.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import the PyPDF2 module.
3. Create a PdfWriter() object for the output PDF.
4. Accept PDF filenames from the user (or define them in code).
5. Open each PDF file using PdfReader().
6. Select and add specific pages from each PDF to the writer object.
7. Write the combined pages into a new PDF file using PdfWriter.write().
8. Close all files.
9. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to merge selected pages from multiple PDFs into a new PDF
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader, PdfWriter
# Step 1: Create a PdfWriter object
writer = PdfWriter()
# Step 2: List of input PDF files
pdf_files = ["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"]
# Step 3: Loop through each PDF file
for pdf in pdf_files:
reader = PdfReader(pdf)
print(f"{pdf} has {len(reader.pages)} pages.")
# Step 4: Select specific pages (example: first 2 pages)
for page_num in range(min(2, len(reader.pages))):
writer.add_page(reader.pages[page_num])
# Step 5: Write to output file
with open("merged_selected_pages.pdf", "wb") as output:
writer.write(output)
print(" Selected pages merged successfully into merged_selected_pages.pdf")

Output:
file1.pdf has 1 pages.
file2.pdf has 1 pages.
Selected pages merged successfully into merged_selected_pages.pdf.

Result:
Thus, the Python program that merges selected pages from multiple PDF files into a new PDF was successfully written,
executed, and verified.
