Title:
Search Phone Number & Email in a File

AIM:
To develop a Python program that searches the text in a file for phone numbers (e.g., +919900889977) and email addresses
(e.g., sample@gmail.com) using regular expressions.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import the re module for regular expressions.
3. Accept a file name from the user.
4. Open the file in read mode and read its content.
5. Define two regular expression patterns:
o For phone numbers: \+91\d{10}
o For email addresses: [\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+
6. Use re.findall() to find all matches in the text.
7. Display the found phone numbers and email addresses.
8. Close the file.
9. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to search phone numbers and email addresses in a file
import re
# Step 1: Accept file name from user
filename = input("Enter the file name: ")
try:
# Step 2: Open and read file content with open(filename, 'r') as file:
content = file.read()
# Step 3: Define regex patterns
phone_pattern = r'\+91\d{10}'
email_pattern = r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+'
# Step 4: Search for matches
phones = re.findall(phone_pattern, content)
emails = re.findall(email_pattern, content)
# Step 5: Display results
print("\nPhone Numbers Found:")
if phones:
for p in phones:
print(p)
else:
print("No phone numbers found.")
print("\nEmail Addresses Found:")
if emails:
for e in emails:
print(e)
else:
print("No email addresses found.")

except FileNotFoundError:
print("Error: File not found. Please check the file name and try again.")

Output:
Enter the file name:sample.text
phone number found:
+91900889977
+918888776655
Email addresses found:
sample@gmail.com
info@college.edu.

Result:
Thus, the Python program that searches the text in a file for phone numbers and email addresses using regular expressions
was successfully written, executed, and verified.
