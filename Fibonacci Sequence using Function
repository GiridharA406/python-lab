Title:
Fibonacci Sequence using Function

AIM:
To write a Python program that accepts a value for N (where N > 0) as input and passes this value to a function that
generates the Fibonacci sequence up to N terms. The program should display a suitable error message if the input condition
is not followed.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Input a value for N from the user.
3. Check if N > 0.
• If not, display an error message and stop the program.
4. Define a function fibonacci(n) that:
• Initializes the first two terms as 0 and 1.
• Uses a loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
• Prints each term of the sequence.
5. Call the function fibonacci(n) with the user input as an argument.
6. Stop the program.


Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to generate Fibonacci sequence using a function
# Function definition
def fibonacci(n):
 a, b = 0, 1
 print("Fibonacci Sequence:")
 for i in range(n):
   print(a, end=" ")
   a, b = b, a + b
# Step 1: Input from user
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms (N > 0): "))
# Step 2: Check the condition for valid input
if n <= 0:
 print("Error: Please enter a positive integer greater than 0.")
else:
 fibonacci(n)

Output:
Enter the number of terms(N>0):12
Fibonacci sequence:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89

Result:
Thus, the Python program that accepts a value for N (where N > 0) and generates the Fibonacci sequence using a function
was successfully written, executed, and verified. The program also correctly displays an appropriate error message when an
invalid (non-positive) input is entered.
