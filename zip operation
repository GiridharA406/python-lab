Title:
ZIP Operation on a Folder — Backup a Folder into a ZIP File

AIM:
To develop a Python program that creates a ZIP backup of a given folder (located in the current working directory) using
appropriate standard library modules and methods.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import required modules: os, shutil, datetime (optional for timestamp).
3. Accept the folder name from the user.
4. Verify the folder exists in the current working directory.
5. Create a destination ZIP file name (e.g., <foldername>_backup.zip or include a timestamp).
6. Use shutil.make_archive() to create the ZIP file from the folder.
7. Inform the user about the success and display the path to the created ZIP file.
8. Handle errors (folder not found, permission errors).
9. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to backup a folder (in current working directory) into a ZIP file
import os
import shutil
from datetime import datetime
def zip_folder(folder_name, add_timestamp=True):
# Ensure folder exists in current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()
folder_path = os.path.join(cwd, folder_name)
if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
raise FileNotFoundError(f"Folder '{folder_name}' not found in {cwd}")
# Prepare base name for the archive (without extension)
if add_timestamp:
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
base_name = os.path.join(cwd, f"{folder_name}_backup_{timestamp}")
else:
base_name = os.path.join(cwd, f"{folder_name}_backup")
# shutil.make_archive will add the .zip extension automatically
archive_path = shutil.make_archive(base_name, 'zip', folder_path)
return archive_path
if name == " main ":
try:
folder = input("Enter the folder name to backup (in current directory): ").strip()
# If user presses enter without name, exit
if not folder:
print("No folder name entered. Exiting.")
else:
zip_path = zip_folder(folder, add_timestamp=True)
print(f"\nBackup created successfully:\n{zip_path}")
except FileNotFoundError as fnf:
print(f"Error: {fnf}")

except PermissionError:
print("Error: Permission denied. Check folder/file permissions.")
except Exception as e:
print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

How to run in VS Code (quick steps):
1. Save the code above as zip_backup.py inside the folder where the target folder is located (i.e., the current working
directory).
2. Make sure the folder you want to backup is present in that directory, e.g., my_project.
3. Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~) and run:
4. python zip_backup.py
5. When prompted, type the folder name (e.g., my_project) and press Enter.

Output (sample run):
Enter the folder name to backup(in current directory):Testfolder
Backup created successfully:

Result:
Thus, the Python program that creates a ZIP backup of a specified folder (from the current working directory) using
shutil.make_archive() was successfully written, executed, and verified. The ZIP file is created in the same directory and the
program reports the full path of the created archive.
