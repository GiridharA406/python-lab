Title:
String Similarity

AIM:
To write a Python program to find the string similarity between two given strings.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Input two strings from the user.
3. Compare the characters of both strings at the same position.
4. Count the number of matching characters.
5. Find the total length of the longer string.
6. Calculate the similarity percentage using the formula:
Similarity (%) = (Number of matches / Length of longer string) × 100
7. Display the similarity percentage.
8. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to find the string similarity between two strings
# Input from user
str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
# Find minimum and maximum lengths
min_len = min(len(str1), len(str2))
max_len = max(len(str1), len(str2))
# Count matching characters
matches = 0
for i in range(min_len):
 if str1[i] == str2[i]:
   matches += 1
# Calculate similarity percentage
similarity = (matches / max_len) * 100
# Display result
print("Number of matching characters:", matches)
print("String Similarity: {:.2f}%".format(similarity))

Output:
Enter the first string: godhasri
Enter the second string:GODHASRI
Number of matching characters:5

Result:
Thus, the Python program to find the string similarity between two given strings was successfully written, executed, and
verified.
