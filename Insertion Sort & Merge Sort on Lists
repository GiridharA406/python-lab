Title:
Insertion Sort & Merge Sort on Lists

AIM:
To write a Python program to implement insertion sort and merge sort using lists.

Algorithm:
Insertion Sort Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Initialize a list with elements.
3. Take one element from the unsorted portion and place it at its correct position in the sorted portion.
4. Repeat the process until all elements are sorted.
5. Display the sorted list.

Merge Sort Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Divide the list into two halves recursively.
3. Sort each half using merge sort.
4. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.
5. Display the sorted list.
6. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to implement Insertion Sort and Merge Sort using lists
# Function for Insertion Sort
def insertion_sort(arr):
 for i in range(1, len(arr)):
  key = arr[i]
  j = i - 1
  while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
 arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
  j -= 1
 arr[j + 1] = key
return arr
# Function for Merge Sort
def merge_sort(arr):
 if len(arr) > 1:
   mid = len(arr) // 2
   left = arr[:mid]
   right = arr[mid:]
   merge_sort(left)
   merge_sort(right)
   i = j = k = 0
  while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
   if left[i] < right[j]:
    arr[k] = left[i]
    i += 1
 else:
    arr[k] = right[j]
    j += 1
   k += 1

while i < len(left):
 arr[k] = left[i]
 i += 1
 k += 1
while j < len(right):
 arr[k] = right[j]
 j += 1
 k += 1
return arr
# Main program
arr = [int(x) for x in input("Enter numbers separated by space: ").split()]
print("Original List:", arr)
print("After Insertion Sort:", insertion_sort(arr.copy()))
print("After Merge Sort:", merge_sort(arr.copy()))

Output:
Enter numbers separated by space: 23 5 56 9 5 9
Original list:[23,5,56,9,5,9]
After intertion sort: [5,5,9,9,23,56]
After merge sort:[5,5,9,9,23,56]

Result:
Thus, the Python program to implement insertion sort and merge sort using lists was successfully written, executed, and
verified.
