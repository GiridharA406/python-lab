Title:
Palindrome Check & Digit Occurrence Count

AIM:
To develop a Python program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not and also count the number of
occurrences of each digit in the input number.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Input a number from the user.
3. Store the original number for comparison.
4. Reverse the number using string slicing.
5. Compare the original number and the reversed number.
6. If both are the same, display that the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
7. Initialize an empty dictionary to count digit occurrences.
8. Use a loop to count each digit in the number.
9. Display the digit and its count.
10. Stop the program.


Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to check whether a number is palindrome
# and count the occurrence of each digit
# Step 1: Input number from user
num = input("Enter a number: ")
# Step 2: Check for palindrome
if num == num[::-1]:
 print("The number is a palindrome.")
else:
 print("The number is not a palindrome.")
# Step 3: Count occurrences of each digit
digit_count = {}
for digit in num:
 digit_count[digit] = digit_count.get(digit, 0) + 1
# Step 4: Display digit occurrences
print("Digit occurrences:")
for digit, count in digit_count.items():
 print(digit, ":", count)

Output:
Enter a  number:1345431
The number is a palindrome 
Digit occurrences:
1:2
3:2
4:2
5:1

Result:
Thus, the Python program to check whether a number is palindrome or not and count the number of occurrences of each
digit was successfully written, executed, and verified.
