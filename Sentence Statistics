Title:
Sentence Statistics

AIM:
To write a Python program that accepts a sentence and finds the number of words, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase
letters.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Input a sentence from the user.
3. Initialize counters for words, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
4. Use a loop to iterate through each character in the sentence.
• If the character is a digit, increment the digit counter.
• If it is an uppercase letter, increment the uppercase counter.
• If it is a lowercase letter, increment the lowercase counter.
5. Split the sentence using split() to count the number of words.
6. Display all counts.
7. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to find number of words, digits,
# uppercase and lowercase letters in a sentence
# Input from user
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
# Initialize counters
words = len(sentence.split())
digits = 0
uppercase = 0
lowercase = 0
# Loop through each character
for ch in sentence:
 if ch.isdigit():
   digits += 1
elif ch.isupper():
   uppercase += 1
elif ch.islower():
   lowercase += 1
# Display results
print("Number of words:", words)
print("Number of digits:", digits)
print("Number of uppercase letters:", uppercase)
print("Number of lowercase letters:", lowercase)

Output:
Number of words: 3
Number of digits: 3
Number of uppercase letters: 1
Number of lowercase letters: 9

Result:
Thus, the Python program that accepts a sentence and finds the number of words, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase
letters was successfully written, executed, and verified.
