Title:
Program to store and update Employee Details using Class in Python

AIM:
To develop a Python program by creating a class called Employee to store the details of employees and implement a
method to update the salary of employees belonging to a given department.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Create a class Employee with attributes:
o name, emp_id, department, salary
3. Define a method display() to show employee details.
4. Define another method update_salary(dept, increment) to increase the salary of all employees in the given
department.
5. Create a list of employee objects.
6. Display employee details before and after updating the salary.
7. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to store and update Employee Details using Class
class Employee:
def init (self, name, emp_id, department, salary):
self.name = name
self.emp_id = emp_id
self.department = department
self.salary = salary
def display(self):
print(f"Name: {self.name}, ID: {self.emp_id}, Department: {self.department}, Salary: {self.salary}")
def update_salary(self, department, increment):
if self.department == department:
self.salary += increment
# Create list of employee objects
employees = [
Employee("kamakshi", 101, "HR", 30000),
Employee("kadambari", 102, "IT", 40000),
Employee("srikari", 103, "IT", 45000),
Employee("vishalakshi", 104, "Finance", 35000)
]
print("Before Salary Update:")
for emp in employees:
emp.display()
# Update salary of IT department employees
dept_name = "IT"
increment_amt = 5000
for emp in employees:
emp.update_salary(dept_name, increment_amt)
print("\nAfter Salary Update:")
for emp in employees:
emp.display()

Output:
Before Salary Update:
Name: kamakshi, ID: 101, Department: HR, Salary: 30000
Name: kadambari, ID: 102, Department: IT, Salary: 40000
Name: srikari, ID: 103, Department: IT, Salary: 45000
Name: vishalakshi, ID: 104, Department: Finance, Salary: 35000

After Salary Update:
Name: kamakshi, ID: 101, Department: HR, Salary: 30000
Name: kadambari, ID: 102, Department: IT, Salary: 45000
Name: srikari, ID: 103, Department: IT, Salary: 50000
Name: vishalakshi, ID: 104, Department: Finance, Salary: 35000

Result:
Thus, the Python program to store employee details and update salary of employees belonging to a given department was
successfully written, executed, and verified.
