Title:
Program to Read and Write Data from a Spreadsheet using Python

AIM:
To develop a Python program to read the data from a spreadsheet and write the data into a spreadsheet using the openpyxl
module.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import the module openpyxl for spreadsheet operations.
3. To write data:
o Create a new workbook using openpyxl.Workbook().
o Select the active sheet and write data into the cells.
o Save the workbook with a desired filename.
4. To read data:
o Open the saved workbook using openpyxl.load_workbook().
o Access the active sheet.
o Read and display the cell data using a loop.
5. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to Read and Write data from a Spreadsheet using openpyxl
import openpyxl
# Writing Data
# Create a new workbook
wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
sheet = wb.active
sheet.title = "EmployeeData"
# Write data into cells
sheet['A1'] = "Name"
sheet['B1'] = "Department"
sheet['C1'] = "Salary"
sheet.append(["sasi", "HR", 30000])
sheet.append(["ravi", "IT", 40000])
sheet.append(["anil", "Finance", 35000])
# Save the workbook
wb.save("employee_data.xlsx")
print("Data written successfully to 'employee_data.xlsx'.")

# Load the existing workbook
wb2 = openpyxl.load_workbook("employee_data.xlsx")
sheet2 = wb2.active
print("\nReading data from 'employee_data.xlsx':")
for row in sheet2.iter_rows(values_only=True):
print(row)

Output:
Data written successfully to 'employee_data.xlsx'.

Reading data from 'employee_data.xlsx':
('Name', 'Department', 'Salary')
('sasi', 'HR', 30000)
('ravi', 'IT', 40000)
('anil', 'Finance', 35000)

Result:
Thus, the Python program to read and write data from a spreadsheet using the openpyxl module was successfully written,
executed, and verified.
