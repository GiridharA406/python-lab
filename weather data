Title:
Fetch Weather Data from the JSON File

AIM:
To write a Python program to fetch and display the current weather data from a JSON file.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Import the json module.
3. Open and read the JSON file containing weather data.
4. Load the JSON data using json.load().
5. Extract weather details like city name, temperature, humidity, and description.
6. Display the extracted information.
7. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to fetch weather data from a JSON file
import json
# Step 1: Open and load the JSON file
with open("weather.json", "r") as file:
data = json.load(file)
# Step 2: Extract required weather information
city = data["city"]
temperature = data["temperature"]
humidity = data["humidity"]
description = data["description"]
# Step 3: Display the data
print("----- Current Weather Report------")
print("City:", city)
print("Temperature:", temperature, "°C")
print("Humidity:", humidity, "%")
print("Weather Description:", description)
Sample JSON File (weather.json):
{
"city": "Hyderabad", "temperature": 30,
"humidity": 65,
"description": "Partly cloudy"
}

Output:
----- Current Weather Report -----
City: chennai
Temperature: 30 °C
Humidity: 65 %
Weather Description: Partly cloudy

Result:
Thus, the Python program to fetch current weather data from a JSON file was successfully written, executed, and
verified.
