Title:
Calculation of Test Average — Finding the Best of Two Test Averages out of Three Test Marks
AIM:
To write a Python program to find the best of two test average marks out of three test marks entered by the user.
Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Input three test marks: test1, test2, and test3.
3. Calculate the sum of all possible pairs:
o (test1 + test2)
o (test2 + test3)
o (test1 + test3)
4. Divide each sum by 2 to find the average of each pair.
5. Find the maximum average among the three.
6. Display the best average.
7. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to find the best of two test average marks out of three test marks
# Step 1: Input three test marks
test1 = float(input("Enter Test 1 marks: "))
test2 = float(input("Enter Test 2 marks: "))
test3 = float(input("Enter Test 3 marks: "))
# Step 2: Calculate all possible averages
avg1 = (test1 + test2) / 2
avg2 = (test2 + test3) / 2
avg3 = (test1 + test3) / 2
# Step 3: Find the best (maximum) average
best_avg = max(avg1, avg2, avg3)
# Step 4: Display the result
print("Best of two test average marks =", best_avg)


Output:
Enter first internal marks:97
Enter second internal marks:98
Enter third internal marks:91
Best of two test average marks =97.5


Result:
Thus, the Python program that accepts three test marks and finds the best of two test average marks was successfully
written, executed, and verified.
