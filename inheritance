Title:
Program using Inheritance to find the Area of Triangle, Circle and Rectangle

AIM:
To develop a Python program using the concept of inheritance to calculate the area of a triangle, circle, and rectangle.

Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Create a base class Shape with a method area() to be overridden.
3. Create derived classes:
o Rectangle → area = length × breadth
o Triangle → area = 0.5 × base × height
o Circle → area = π × radius2
4. Initialize each class with respective parameters.
5. Create objects for each class and call their area() methods.
6. Display the calculated areas.
7. Stop the program.

Python Program (Source Code):
# Program to find area of Triangle, Circle and Rectangle using Inheritance
import math
# Base class
class Shape:
def area(self):
pass
# Derived class for Rectangle
class Rectangle(Shape):
def init (self, length, breadth):
self.length = length
self.breadth = breadth
def area(self):
return self.length * self.breadth
# Derived class for Triangle
class Triangle(Shape):
def init (self, base, height):
self.base = base
self.height = height
def area(self):
return 0.5 * self.base * self.height
# Derived class for Circle
class Circle(Shape):
def init (self, radius):
self.radius = radius
def area(self):
return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
# Create objects and display areas
rect = Rectangle(10, 5)

tri = Triangle(8, 6)
cir = Circle(7)
print("Area of Rectangle:", rect.area())
print("Area of Triangle:", tri.area())
print("Area of Circle:", round(cir.area(), 2))

Output:
Area of rectangle:50
Area of triangle:24.0
Area of circle:153.94

Result:
Thus, the Python program to find the area of triangle, circle, and rectangle using inheritance was successfully written,
executed, and verified.
